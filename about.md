Hello, I'm QC. I like bunnies, Vim, light mode, Oxford commas, and Having
Opinions. I break things a lot. Occasionally I fix them.

I'm an "everything" software engineer from Melbourne, Australia. I've spent
several years working across both product and platform engineering -- you might
call this "impressive breadth of knowledge", or "seeks novelty, like a lab rat".

I collect interests (both personal and professional) like Pokémon, which means
if you want to know about a topic you can just mention something that grabs my
attention and the next morning I will have 1) all the information and 2) a
severe lack of sleep. Sometimes I speak or write about these interests, and
I'm always open to suggestions!

I am a very normal human being and *definitely not a rabbit at all*. My career
exists to fund my board game addiction.
